# 507final: Data Structure
This README serves the purpose of describing my data structure (graphs), and how the data is organized into this data structure. 

This data is organized using two separate tables initially. These tables were then merged into one dataset/table that combined the columns of each of the tables. The first dataset, the ACS df, utilizes almost exclusively numerical data values, aside from a column detailing each state, and another column that was omitted from the utilized data. This table has  51 rows, as it includes the District of Columbia as its own state and 75 columns. The second table from the Urban Data Catalog has also mostly numerical data. This data frame has 51 columns also for the same reason and 28 columns. The third and final dataset is the combined table of both data frames. This table was the table utilized in making my graphs for my data structure. This table has 51 rows and 103 columns, but 3 were categorical variables eliminated from the creation of the correlation matrix.

There are four graphs created from this data structure. The first is a graph showcasing the network of all points in the correlation matrix. Image 2 shows the network of positive correlations in the matrix. Note that this image is exactly the same as Image 1 due to the fact that every point in the matrix had a positive correlation. There were no negative correlations, meaning these images created the exact same network. Please also note that there are no images of negative correlation networks in this project for this same reason, as these graphs could not be produced with this data. Image 3 displays the positive correlations of the network, but it looks different due to the following changes in styling the edges based on their weights: increases in the value of weights so that they are more visible in the graph, edge colors based on weight direction, and edges based on weight parameter. Image 4 displays the positive correlation but shows what it looks like to filter the edges based on minimum correlation. Although I recognize that in typical correlational research, any correlation above 0.7 is considered to be strong, my correlational values all appeared extremely high, most above 0.95. For this purpose, I decided to choose a minimum correlation value of 0.97 to reflect this extreme relationship in my data and depict a graph that would look different than Image 3.
